## N-Gram (Count based)

N-gram is the way of extracting n serial items. 

Items could be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs. If the item is the word, then it could be called *shingles*. The N-Gram are classified as unigram, bigram, trigram, ... etc.

**N-gram Model**

N-gram models models sequences, notably natural language, using the properties of n-grams. There are two ways. One is count-based and the other is neural based. For detail, see the [link](http://media.podcasts.ox.ac.uk/comlab/deep_learning_NLP/2017-01_deep_NLP_3_modelling_1.mp4).
