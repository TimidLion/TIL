Public explanation : [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.

It may takes 1 sec for updating, however, it could be dynamically changed with some 'GET', 'PUT', 'POST', and etc.
