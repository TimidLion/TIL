# Query Execution in Spark

![Query Execution](./img/QueryExecution.png)

QueryExecution is the result of executing a LogicalPlan in a SparkSession

When you execute an operator on a Dataset it triggers query execution that gives the good ol' RDD of internal binary rows, i.e. RDD[InternalRow], that is Sparkâ€™s execution plan followed by executing an RDD action and so the result of the structured query.


lazy attributes are in here

```
dataset.queryExecution.executedPlan
```

QueryExecution uses the Catalyst Query Optimizer and Tungsten for better structured query performance.


***QueryExecution*** uses the input ***SparkSession*** to access the current SparkPlanner when it is created.

It then computes a SparkPlan (a physicalPlan) using the planner.
